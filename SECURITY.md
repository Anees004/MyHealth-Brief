# Security – What Not to Push (Public Repo)

Do **not** commit these to a public repo. They contain API keys and identifiers for your Firebase project and can be abused (quota, billing, unauthorized access).

## Files to keep local (already in .gitignore)

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `lib/firebase_options.dart` | Firebase API keys, project ID, OAuth client IDs (generated by FlutterFire CLI) |
| `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` | Same for iOS – API key, client IDs, project ID |
| `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` | Same for macOS |
| `android/app/google-services.json` | Same for Android |
| `.env` / `.env.*` | Often used for Gemini API key or other secrets |

## If you already pushed them

1. **Stop committing them**  
   They are in `.gitignore` now, so new commits won’t add them.

2. **Remove from the next commit** (so they’re no longer tracked):
   ```bash
   git rm --cached lib/firebase_options.dart 2>/dev/null || true
   git rm --cached ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist 2>/dev/null || true
   git rm --cached macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist 2>/dev/null || true
   git rm --cached android/app/google-services.json 2>/dev/null || true
   git commit -m "chore: stop tracking Firebase config and secrets"
   ```

3. **Rotate / restrict keys** (they may already be in git history):
   - [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → your project **myhealth-brief** → APIs & Services → **Credentials**  
   - Regenerate or restrict the Firebase API keys (e.g. limit by app bundle ID / package name).  
   - Optionally create a **separate Firebase project** for the public repo and use that in the open-source app so your main project’s keys stay private.

4. **Gemini API key**  
   The app uses a placeholder `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `lib/main.dart`. Do not replace it with a real key in the repo. Use environment variables or a secrets manager and pass the key at runtime.

## For people cloning the repo

- Run **`flutterfire configure`** (after creating/adding a Firebase project) to generate `firebase_options.dart` and the platform config files locally, or  
- Add your own `GoogleService-Info.plist` and `google-services.json` from the Firebase Console.  
- Set the Gemini API key via env or config, not by committing it.
